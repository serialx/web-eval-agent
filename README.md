## 🔥 Supercharge Your Debugging

[operative.sh](https://www.operative.sh)'s MCP Server launches a browser-use powered agent to autonomously execute and debug web apps directly in your code editor.

## ⚡ Features

- 🌐 **Navigate your webapp** using BrowserUse (2x faster with operative backend)
- 📊 **Capture network traffic** - all requests/responses at your fingertips
- 🚨 **Collect console errors** - nothing escapes detection
- 🤖 **Autonomous debugging** - the Cursor agent calls the web QA agent mcp server to test if the code it wrote works as epected end-to-end.

## 🏁 Quick Start (macOS/Linux)

1. Pre-requisites: brew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`, npm: (`brew install npm`), jq: `brew install jq` 
2. Run the installer after [getting an api key (free)](https://www.operative.sh) 
```bash
# Feel welcome to inspect the installer script like so:
# curl -LSf https://operative.sh/install.sh | less -N
# Download, install, and remove the installer script
curl -LSf https://operative.sh/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh && rm install.sh
```
3. Unleash the agent in Cursor Agent Mode with web_eval_agent (verify tool refreshed or restart Cursor)
