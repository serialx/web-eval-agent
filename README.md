## 🔥 Supercharge Your Debugging

[operative.sh](https://www.operative.sh)'s MCP Server launches a browser-use powered agent to autonomously execute and debug web apps directly in your code editor.

## ⚡ Features

- 🌐 **Navigate your webapp** using BrowserUse (2x faster with operative backend)
- 📊 **Capture network traffic** - requests are intelligently filtered and returned into the context window
- 🚨 **Collect console errors** - captures logs & errors
- 🤖 **Autonomous debugging** - the Cursor agent calls the web QA agent mcp server to test if the code it wrote works as epected end-to-end.

## 🏁 Quick Start (macOS/Linux)

1. Pre-requisites (typically not needed):
 - brew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

3. Run the installer after [getting an api key (free)](https://www.operative.sh)

curl -LSf https://operative.sh/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh && rm install.sh
```
3. Visit your favorite IDE and restart to apply the changes
4. Send a prompt in chat mode to call the web eval agent tool! e.g. 
```bash
Test my app on http://localhost:3000. Use web-eval-agent.
